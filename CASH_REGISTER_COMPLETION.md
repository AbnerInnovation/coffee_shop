# Cash Register System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the complete cash register system implementation including payment method tracking, detailed reports, and denomination counting.

## Phase 1: Payment Method Tracking ✅

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `backend/migrations/versions/add_payment_method_to_transactions.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `payment_method` enum column (CASH, CARD, DIGITAL, OTHER)
  - Added `category` column for expense categorization
  
#### 2. Models Updated
- **File**: `backend/app/models/cash_register.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `PaymentMethod` enum
  - Added `payment_method` and `category` fields to `CashTransaction` model

#### 3. Schemas Updated
- **File**: `backend/app/schemas/cash_register.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `PaymentMethod` enum to schemas
  - Updated `CashTransactionBase`, `CashTransactionCreate`, and `CashTransactionUpdate`
  - Payment method now tracked on all transactions

#### 4. Services Updated
- **File**: `backend/app/services/cash_register.py`
- **Changes**:
  - `create_transaction_from_order()` now accepts and stores payment method
  - Automatically maps order payment method to transaction

#### 5. API Updated
- **File**: `backend/app/api/routers/orders.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Order payment endpoint now passes payment method to transaction creation

### How It Works
1. When an order is paid, the payment method is captured
2. A cash register transaction is created with the payment method
3. Payment methods are tracked for reporting and reconciliation

## Phase 2: Detailed Reports (In Progress)

### Report Types to Implement

#### 1. Daily Summary Report
- Total sales by payment method
- Total expenses by category
- Net cash flow
- Transaction count
- Tips collected
- Refunds processed

#### 2. Weekly Summary Report
- Aggregated daily summaries
- Trends and comparisons
- Best/worst performing days
- Expense patterns

#### 3. Monthly Summary Report
- Full month overview
- Category breakdowns
- Payment method distribution
- Profit margins

#### 4. Session Comparison Report
- Compare current session to previous sessions
- Average transaction value
- Transactions per hour
- Peak times

### Frontend Components Needed
1. Reports dashboard view
2. Date range selector
3. Report type selector
4. Export functionality (PDF/Excel)
5. Charts and visualizations

## Phase 3: Cash Drawer Denomination Counting

### Features to Implement

#### 1. Opening Count
- Count bills by denomination ($100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1)
- Count coins by denomination ($1, $0.25, $0.10, $0.05, $0.01)
- Calculate total opening balance
- Store denomination breakdown

#### 2. Closing Count
- Count bills and coins at session close
- Compare to expected balance
- Calculate variance by denomination
- Identify discrepancies

#### 3. Cut Count
- Perform denomination count during cut
- Track cash removed from drawer
- Update expected balance
- Generate reconciliation report

### Database Schema for Denominations

```sql
CREATE TABLE cash_denominations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id INTEGER REFERENCES cash_register_sessions(id),
    count_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'opening', 'closing', 'cut'
    count_time TIMESTAMP,
    -- Bills
    bills_100 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    bills_50 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    bills_20 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    bills_10 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    bills_5 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    bills_1 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    -- Coins
    coins_100 INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- $1 coins
    coins_25 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- quarters
    coins_10 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- dimes
    coins_5 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- nickels
    coins_1 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- pennies
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### UI Components for Denomination Counting

1. **Denomination Input Grid**
   - Visual representation of bills/coins
   - Quick increment/decrement buttons
   - Auto-calculation of totals
   - Keyboard shortcuts for fast entry

2. **Variance Display**
   - Expected vs Actual comparison
   - Color-coded differences
   - Denomination-level breakdown
   - Suggested corrections

3. **History View**
   - Past denomination counts
   - Variance trends
   - User performance tracking

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Migration ⏳
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend Services ⏳
- Add payment method to transaction display
- Show payment method in transaction list
- Add payment method filter

### Step 3: Create Reports System ⏳
- Build report generation service
- Create report API endpoints
- Design report UI components
- Add export functionality

### Step 4: Implement Denomination Counting ⏳
- Create denomination model and migration
- Build denomination counting UI
- Add variance calculation logic
- Integrate with session open/close/cut

### Step 5: Testing & Polish ⏳
- Test all payment method tracking
- Verify report accuracy
- Test denomination counting
- Performance optimization

## Benefits

### For Cashiers
- Faster transaction processing
- Clear denomination counting interface
- Reduced counting errors
- Better end-of-shift reconciliation

### For Managers
- Detailed financial reports
- Payment method insights
- Expense tracking by category
- Variance analysis
- Trend identification

### For Business Owners
- Complete financial visibility
- Data-driven decisions
- Fraud detection
- Audit trail
- Compliance reporting

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete payment method tracking (backend done)
2. ⏳ Update frontend to display payment methods
3. ⏳ Build reports system
4. ⏳ Implement denomination counting
5. ⏳ Add export functionality
6. ⏳ Create analytics dashboard

## Notes

- All monetary values use DECIMAL(10, 2) for precision
- Payment methods are stored as enums for data integrity
- Reports are cached for performance
- Denomination counts are immutable once submitted
- All changes are logged for audit purposes
